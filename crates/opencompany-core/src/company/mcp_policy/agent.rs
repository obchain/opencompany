//! The per-agent layer of a server's tool policy: one teammate's own decisions
//! about the tools on a server the company already reaches.
//!
//! This layer may only narrow. A stored per-agent mode moves the resolved mode
//! along `AlwaysAllow < NeedsApproval < Blocked` in the restricting direction
//! only: [`ApprovalMode::max_restrictive`] is the only way it reaches the
//! result, and the transport's filter consults deny before allow, so a widening
//! rule could not be enforced. A stored setting the clamp discards is reported
//! as [`PolicySource::AgentClamped`] rather than dropped.
