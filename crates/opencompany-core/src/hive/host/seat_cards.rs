//! The cards one episode opens, and the card each seat's publish lands on.

//! A room answers one operator message with several seats, so the board has
//! to be held to the message rather than to the seat: at most
//! [`EPISODE_CARD_CAP`] cards, one per normalized title, the card the REST
//! handler already opened for the message taken over by the first
//! `spawn_task` rather than duplicated, and every publish filed on a card the
//! episode already has before a new one is minted.
//!
//! [`EpisodeCards`] is that bookkeeping. It is the [`CardBudget`] a seat's
//! `spawn_task` reserves against in its own turn, and [`EpisodeCards::open`]
//! writes what the turn queued once it settles. A resumed episode reads its
//! cards back with [`EpisodeCards::recall`] so the limits survive the restart.
