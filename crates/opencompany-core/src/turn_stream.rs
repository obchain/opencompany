//! Transient per-turn progress bus — the live tool-call timeline that rides the
//! company SSE feed *while a turn is still running*.
//!
//! This mirrors OpenHuman's web-chat event bus
//! (`vendor/openhuman/crates/openhuman-core/src/web_chat/event_bus.rs`): a process-wide
//! `tokio::sync::broadcast` fabric, one sender per company, that the harness
//! publishes each mapped [`AgentProgress`](openhuman) event onto the instant it
//! happens, and that the operator SSE route ([`company_events`]) fans back out
//! to every watching console.
//!
//! It is deliberately **separate from the durable company event log**
//! ([`CompanyEvent`](crate::ports::types::CompanyEvent) / [`EventLog`]):
//!
//! * Tool-call progress is high-volume and ephemeral — one turn can emit dozens
//!   of start/complete pairs. Journaling it would bloat the audit log and the
//!   GraphQL `Chat.history` for no lasting value.
//! * The durable, operator-facing timeline is still folded into
//!   [`TurnStep`](crate::ports::types::TurnStep)s at turn end
//!   ([`fold_steps`](crate::harness::steps::fold_steps)) and rides the final
//!   chat reply. This bus only makes those same steps *appear live* first.
//!
//! ## Security
//!
//! The bus carries only the **already-scrubbed** projection produced by
//! [`crate::harness::steps`] — a label, a redacted argument line, a result
//! *summary*, a typed failure, an elapsed time, a status. It never carries raw
//! tool output, exactly like `fold_steps`; arguments reach it only through
//! issue #372's host-side redactor, and a remote body reaches it only as a
//! shape (issue #411). The mapping that enforces all of that lives next to
//! `fold_steps` (same helpers, same rules); this module is a dumb transport and
//! models no openhuman types, so it stays compiled in the default
//! (non-`openhuman`) build where it simply has no publishers and every
//! subscription is an empty stream.
