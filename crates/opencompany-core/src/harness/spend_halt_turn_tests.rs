//! Issue #1032: end-to-end proof that a turn stopped by its in-turn spend brake
//! **says so** — and that it says something different from a turn that paused at
//! its step cap.
//!
//! The bug is a silence, and a silence built in by construction rather than
//! forgotten. #988 armed the brake: a teammate that declares a
//! `budget_usd_daily` gets a [`BudgetStopHook`] that halts a turn outrunning it.
//! But openhuman's tool loop consumes the hook's `StopDecision::Stop { reason }`
//! internally, stops iterating, and returns the run's text as an ordinary
//! `Ok(reply)` — so "I ran out of budget" and "I finished the work" arrive at the
//! operator as the same bubble. `Agent::last_turn_hit_cap()` cannot stand in
//! either: it is `false` for a spend halt, which is exactly what #988 pinned.
//!
//! Nothing shorter than a real turn can show this.
//! [`MockProvider`](crate::harness::provider::MockProvider) issues no tool
//! calls, so a turn against it is one iteration long and no between-iteration
//! hook ever fires. So this drives the **real** harness — real `build_agent`,
//! real [`HostedProvider`], real pool, real brain — and scripts exactly one
//! thing: the model's choices, over a loopback OpenAI-compatible endpoint. The
//! shape [`cap_turn_tests`](super::cap_turn_tests) and
//! `built_in::iteration_cap_turn_test` established.
//!
//! The lever that makes the brake fire is `prompt_tokens`: the stop-hook
//! middleware folds the usage the *provider* reports into openhuman's turn cost,
//! so a script that reports a million prompt tokens crosses a five-cent cap on
//! its first iteration.
//!
//! What each test is for:
//!
//! - the halt reaches [`TurnOutcome::halted_for_spend`] with the right figures,
//!   and — the negative control that stops a hardcoded `Some` passing — a turn
//!   that finishes reports `None`;
//! - a teammate that declared no budget can never report one, because no hook is
//!   installed for it;
//! - the brain emits the halt as a **second, unauthored** bubble;
//! - the spend notice and the step-cap notice do **not** cross-fire, asserted in
//!   both directions;
//! - and the notice never reaches memory, for the reason #926 established.
