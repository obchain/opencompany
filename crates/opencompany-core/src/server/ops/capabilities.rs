//! Capability-budget read surface (issue #108): the company's effective tier
//! plan and how much of each tier's token budget the current period has spent.
//!
//! A read-only companion to the harness gate — the console renders one row per
//! configured tier (budget, spend, remaining, whether its tools are disabled).
//! With no `[plan]` configured the response is `{ configured: false }` and the
//! console shows a "no token plan configured" note. The heavy lifting is the
