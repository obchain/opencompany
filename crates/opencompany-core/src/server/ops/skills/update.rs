//! `POST …/skills/{slug}/update` — move a registry install onto the library's
//! current document.
//!
//! An install pins a snapshot, so a library edit never reaches an existing
//! install on its own. That is deliberate: a document that joins every agent's
//! prompt company-wide must not change under a company because someone
//! republished it. This route is the other half of that decision — the explicit
//! act that takes the newer document, with the operator having seen what moves.
//!
//! ## Four refusals, each naming itself
//!
//! There is no newer document to take (`SKILL_NOT_PINNED`,
//! `SKILL_LEFT_REGISTRY`, `SKILL_ALREADY_CURRENT`), or taking it would destroy
//! something (`SKILL_MODIFIED_NO_UPDATE`). They are separate sentences rather
//! than one "can't update this" because they ask the operator for four different
//! things — and the modified case asks for a decision no route may make for
//! them, since the edit it would overwrite exists nowhere else.
//!
//! The yes/no itself is [`SkillDrift::update_allowed`], the same predicate the
//! reads project and the console mirrors. A second copy of that rule here would
//! be a rule that drifts.
//!
//! ## An update is a write, held to a write's gates
//!
//! The library's document is re-rendered, size-checked and **re-scanned** before
//! it is stored. A library entry that has since grown something the content scan
//! refuses must not reach a company through an update when an install of the
//! same slug would have been refused. `enabled` is carried from the existing row:
//! taking a newer document says nothing about wanting a disabled skill switched
//! back on.
