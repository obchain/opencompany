//! GraphQL read plane: the single read surface behind every console view.
//!
//! The schema is rooted at a [`Company`](company::CompanyGql) aggregation
//! object so a view fetches everything it needs in one round trip; the only
//! top-level queries are `companies`, `company(id)`, and `skillRegistry`. The
//! [`Schema`] is built **once at startup** ([`build_schema`]) and stored on
//! [`AppState`](crate::AppState); each request injects its resolved
//! [`GqlAuth`](auth::GqlAuth) principal via request data. Mutations and
//! subscriptions are out of scope — REST owns the write plane.
