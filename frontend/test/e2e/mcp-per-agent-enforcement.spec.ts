/**
 * A per-teammate block reaches the agent, on its next turn, with no restart.
 *
 * This is the spec the whole staleness fix exists for. Before it, a tool set to
 * Block kept being callable: the deny list is baked into the roster attachment
 * at build time, and the staleness fingerprint did not hash the policy
 * document, so writing a permission invalidated nothing. It took a host restart
 * to apply — which the docs already claimed was unnecessary.
 *
 * Unit tests pin the fingerprint moving and the attachment denying. Only this
 * one pins the thing an operator actually cares about: the agent stops being
 * able to call it, without anybody bouncing the host.
 *
 * Needs the `openhuman` and `mcp` features plus an inference backend, so it runs
 * in the live-brain lane. The server it drives is registered here against that
 * lane's local `mcp-server.mjs`, not the manifest's `deepwiki`: the rows are the
 * probed inventory, and reading them off the public network would make this
 * spec's verdict depend on it.
 *
 * Serial: each test leaves a permission written that the next
 * one reads or clears, which is the same order an operator moves through.
